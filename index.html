        <p>
          Testkey.online is a very simple application made to see which keys are currently being pressed on the keyboard
          of the user
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason this site exists is that I had rebound a key on my keyboard, and wanted to make sure it was working
          properly, and the easiest way I could think of was to type an URL, and just hit the key.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other sites like this one I could find were either on urls I couldn't easily remember, or they didn't work
          properly with my nordic keyboard, so I decided to make this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site isn't pretty, and there are probably issues I haven't noticed, or features that could be implemented
          to make it more useful. If you can think of anyone, feel free to create an issue on
          <a href="https://github.com/madsroskar/testkey" target="_blank">Github</a>, or just fork it and submit a pull
          request. It's all plain javascript, and CSS. :)
