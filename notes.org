#+TITLE: Notes

* Todo
** TODO Move the application into `/app`
** TODO Change the buttons container to Flex rather than Stack
** TODO Add a small "about this" thingy
** TODO Figure something out for mobile
*** Ideas
**** Display a message to inform that it's not available/helpful for mobile
**** Have an input field for mobile to be able to test with keyboards built-in
I don't really know if this is helpful at all, or at least in a similar way
to how I use it on desktop. I guess there's a case for being able to try out
swipe and such features, but i'm not sure that's worth :D
